# Kaggle-Bike-Sharing

In this project, our goal is to predict the number of bikes to be rented on a future day using the dataset provided by the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington. For each forecast, we can only use the data prior to the forecasting date and predict the number of rentals using various predictive modelling algorithms and achieve the lowest RMSLE score on Kaggle with better predictive attributes and parameters
